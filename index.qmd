I am currently a PhD candidate in Statistics at the University of Connecticut. As a research assistant, my primary focus revolves around clustered data analysis using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). In addition, I actively contribute to website development and clustering analysis as a part of the UConn EnergyStats team. I am also deeply involved in child maltreatment detection at the UConn Health Center. My educational background comprises a BS in Actuarial Science from both Heriot-Watt University and Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, along with an MS in Data Science from University College London.
